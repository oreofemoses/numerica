# Ultimate Tech Stack and Step-by-Step Guide

## Project Description
This web application is designed as a comprehensive library of numerical methods for solving differential equations, root-finding, differentiation, and integration. It is aimed at researchers, students, and instructors who require accurate and efficient computational tools for mathematical modeling and analysis. The platform will feature an intuitive user interface for inputting problem parameters, selecting numerical methods, and visualizing results. 

Key Features:
- **Differential Equations:** Support for initial value problems (IVPs) and boundary value problems (BVPs) using methods like Runge-Kutta, Adams-Bashforth, and finite difference methods.
- **Root-Finding Algorithms:** Implementation of methods such as Newton-Raphson, Bisection, and Secant methods for solving nonlinear equations.
- **Numerical Differentiation:** Support for forward, backward, and central difference approximations.
- **Numerical Integration:** Implementation of techniques like Trapezoidal Rule, Simpson’s Rule, and Gaussian Quadrature.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Real-time graphical representation of results using modern charting libraries.
- **RESTful API:** Provides programmatic access for integrating numerical computations into other applications.
- **User Authentication and Data Persistence:** Allows users to save and retrieve problem settings and results.
- **Cloud-Based Deployment:** Ensures accessibility from any device with an internet connection.
